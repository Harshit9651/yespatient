            <h2>My Background</h2>
            <p>My name is Harshit Sharma, and I am a student pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering. Coming from a family where my father works as a taxi driver, funding my education posed a significant challenge. However, I was determined to pursue my Bachelor's degree, even if it meant facing rejection from banks due to my father's poor credit score.</p>

            <h2>Challenges Faced</h2>
            <p>I spent countless hours at various banks, facing disappointment and frustration as many rejected my loan applications. Despite the hurdles, I managed to secure admission to college. It was a new world for me, as I encountered English books and teachers for the first time, coming from a Hindi medium background.</p>
